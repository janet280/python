Coffee Shop Order System
Purpose:
This Python script simulates a simple coffee shop order system. It allows users to select items from a menu, specify quantity, and calculate the total cost. It also includes a basic customer recognition system with a humorous twist.

Functionality:

Displays a menu of available coffee drinks.
Prompts the user to select an item from the menu.
Calculates the price based on the selected item.
Offers an optional add-on (whipped cream for lattes).
Handles out-of-stock items gracefully.
Calculates the total cost based on quantity.
Includes a simple customer recognition system with a humorous "evil" check.

Usage:

Save the code as a Python script (e.g., coffee_shop.py).
Run the script from your terminal: python coffee_shop.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to place your order.

Limitations:

The menu and prices are hardcoded.
The "evil" check is for entertainment purposes only.
The script does not handle payment or order fulfillment.
The script does not validate user input for errors or inconsistencies.

Potential Improvements:

Implement a database to store menu items, prices, and customer information.
Add features like order history, loyalty programs, and employee management.
Improve the user interface for a better user experience.
Enhance the "evil" check with more complex logic.
